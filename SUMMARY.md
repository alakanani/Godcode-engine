# 🧬 God Code – One Page Summary

### 🪶 Vision
**God Code** is the first spiritually-inspired programming language that blends AI logic, metaphysical syntax, and blockchain integrity to allow users to **code with soul**.

### 🔍 What It Is
A creative, divine logic language using expressive commands such as:
- `DECLARE name AS value`
- `REVEAL("truth")`
- `ASCEND`
- `IF ... THEN ... ELSE ...`

It allows developers, thinkers, and spiritual technologists to build code infused with purpose, revelation, and higher reasoning.
