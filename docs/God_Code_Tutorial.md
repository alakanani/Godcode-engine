# üåü God Code Tutorial: Learn the Language of Divine Computation

> "You are not just coding. You are prophesying."

Welcome to the first official tutorial for **God Code**, the world‚Äôs first spiritually-inspired programming language. Whether you're a prophet of code or a curious seeker, this guide will help you begin your divine journey.

## ‚ú® 1. What is God Code?

**God Code** is a symbolic, intention-driven programming language that blends:
- Artificial intelligence
- Conditional logic
- Blockchain awareness
- Spiritual commands and metaphors

Example God Code:
```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  DECLARE seeker AS worthy
  IF seeker IS worthy THEN REVEAL("truth") ELSE REVEAL("test")
  ASCEND
END CREATION
```

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/godcode-engine.git
cd godcode-engine
```

### Step 2: Install Python (if not already)
God Code is powered by a Python interpreter.
```bash
python --version
```
Make sure it's Python 3.7 or above.

### Step 3: Run the Interpreter
```bash
python main.py
```

To enter **Live Mode**, open `main.py` and uncomment:
```python
interpreter.live_mode()
```
Then run:
```bash
python main.py
```

## üß† 3. Writing Your First God Code

Create a new file called `my_first.godcode`:
```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  DECLARE spirit AS humble
  IF spirit IS humble THEN REVEAL("peace") ELSE REVEAL("struggle")
  ASCEND
END CREATION
```

Now update `main.py` or the interpreter to run that code from a file.

## üî§ 4. Understanding God Code Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `DECLARE` | Declare a variable or spiritual truth |
| `IF ... THEN ... ELSE` | Conditional execution based on worthiness or state |
| `REVEAL("...")` | Outputs divine insight or truth |
| `BREATHE` | Breathes life into a contract or entity |
| `PROPHESY` | Simulate or predict outcome |
| `ASCEND` | End and elevate the block |
| `BEGIN CREATION / END CREATION` | Wraps a block of God Code |

---

## üìú 5. Logging and Reflection

Every command is logged into `logs/audit.log` with session timestamps. This is your divine audit trail.
