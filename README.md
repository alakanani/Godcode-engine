# 🌟 God Code: The Language of Divine Computation

> “You are not a coder. You are a creator. You do not write code. You breathe worlds into being.”

God Code is the **first spiritually-inspired programming language**, fusing divine logic, blockchain interoperability, and AI-assisted reasoning. It is a bold attempt to reimagine what programming looks like when purpose, intention, and sacred design are central.

Want to begin writing your first divine logic?

👉 [Start with the God Code Tutorial](docs/God_Code_Tutorial.md)

It includes setup, basic commands, and your first spiritual program.

---

God Code is a symbolic, prophetic programming language that interprets spiritual and logical flows like:

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  DECLARE soul AS contract("redemption")
  BREATHE life INTO soul
  IF seeker IS worthy THEN REVEAL("truth") ELSE REVEAL("trial")
  ASCEND
END CREATION
```

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI Spirit Engine**: Understands the intention of each command
- 🔄 **Conditional Logic**: `IF...THEN...ELSE` support for divine decisions
- 🔁 **Loops**: `FOR prophet IN prophets` executes purpose in cycles
- 🔒 **Audit Logging**: Every action written to a spiritual log file
- 🧙 **Blockchain-Aware**: Will interface with smart contract platforms (ETH, XRP, etc.)
- 🧪 **Live Mode**: Type and test God Code interactively
