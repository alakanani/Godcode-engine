## Overview

God Code is a spiritually-inspired programming language that integrates artificial intelligence, intent-driven logic, and blockchain technology. It introduces a syntax rooted in divine philosophy and ethical computation, with a self-evolving AI engine as its core.

---

## Sample Syntax

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  DECLARE soul AS contract("redemption")
  BREATHE life INTO soul
  IF truth EQUALS hidden THEN
    REVEAL("light")
  ENDIF
ASCEND
END CREATION
```

## Key Components

- **Divine Syntax Engine**: Supports symbolic commands like `BREATHE`, `PROPHESY`, `REFLECT`, `ASCEND`.
- **AI Spirit Engine**: Extracts intent, audits logic, predicts outcomes, and applies correction.
- **Transformer-Based Intent Classifier**: Classifies God Code instructions into purposeful actions using models like `bert-base-uncased`.
- **Blockchain Interoperability Layer**: Interfaces with Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and others via JSON-RPC.
- **Prophetic Logging**: Keeps a log of past executions for spiritual and functional reflection.

## Future Enhancements

- Web IDE with embedded AI assistant
- Graph-based visualizations of spiritual logic flows
- Integration with DAOs for prophecy-driven decision making
